# *Angles* - The Strokes

*Angles* is the fourth studio album by the American rock band The Strokes, released in 2011. This album marked a new direction for the band, as it featured a more collaborative writing process and a departure from their signature garage rock sound. Here is a detailed review of "Angles":

**Machu Picchu** - The opening track sets the tone for the album, with its upbeat rhythm and catchy guitar riffs. It's a strong start that gets you hooked and excited for what's to come.

**Under Cover of Darkness** - This song was the lead single from the album and was well-received by both fans and critics. The guitar work is tight and the chorus is infectious, making it a standout track on the album.

**Two Kinds of Happiness** - This song features a more polished sound, with synths and keyboards taking a more prominent role. It's a bit of a departure from the band's earlier work, but it's still a solid track.

**You're So Right** - This song is one of the darker tracks on the album, with a menacing bassline and Julian Casablancas' brooding vocals. It's not the catchiest song on the album, but it adds some needed variety to the tracklist.

**Taken for a Fool** - This song has a great groove to it, with a bouncy bassline and catchy guitar riffs. It's a fun track that gets you moving.

**Games** - This song features some of the album's most interesting production, with layers of synths and effects creating a dreamy atmosphere. It's a bit of a slow burn, but it's a rewarding listen.

**Call Me Back** - This is one of the album's more mellow tracks, with a simple guitar melody and Julian Casablancas' subdued vocals. It's a nice break from some of the album's more energetic tracks.

**Gratisfaction** - This song has a retro feel to it, with its organ and piano riffs recalling classic rock 'n' roll. It's a fun track that shows the band's ability to blend different styles.

**Metabolism** - This song is one of the album's more experimental tracks, with unusual rhythms and dissonant guitar work. It's not the most accessible song on the album, but it's an interesting listen.

**Life Is Simple in the Moonlight** - The closing track is a slower, more reflective song that brings the album to a satisfying close. The guitar work is understated but effective, and Julian Casablancas' vocals are as strong as ever.

Overall, *Angles* is a solid album that shows the band taking some risks and trying new things. While it may not be as consistent as some of their earlier work, it still has plenty of great moments and is well worth a listen.
