"Plastic Love" (Japanese: プラスティック・ラヴ, Hepburn: Purasutikku Ravu) is a song by Japanese city pop singer Mariya Takeuchi, featured on her 1984 album Variety. Upon its release as a single a year later, it was moderately successful, selling around 10,000 copies.

In 2017, "Plastic Love" saw a resurgence internationally when an eight-minute remix of the song was uploaded to YouTube. It quickly garnered more than 24 million views, before a copyright claim over the album art unintentionally led to its removal. It was subsequently restored in 2019 and has garnered over 63 million views.

### Review
"Plastic Love" by Mariya Takeuchi is a popular city pop song that has gained a lot of attention in recent years. The song has a groovy and upbeat melody that is easy to listen to, but the lyrics are more melancholic and tell the story of a woman who is searching for love in a world that feels artificial and fake. The vocals are smooth and complement the instrumentation well, creating an overall enjoyable listening experience. "Plastic Love" has become a fan favorite and is often cited as one of the best examples of Japanese city pop. If you're looking for a catchy tune with meaningful lyrics, I would definitely recommend giving "Plastic Love" a listen.
