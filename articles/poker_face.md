## Lady Gaga

"Poker Face" is a song by American singer Lady Gaga from her debut studio album, The Fame (2008).
It was released on September 23, 2008, as the album's second single. It is a synth-pop song in 
the key of Gâ™¯ minor, following in the footsteps of her previous single "Just Dance", but with a
darker musical tone. The main idea behind the song is bisexuality and was a tribute by Gaga to
her rock and roll boyfriends. The song's lyrics feature various sexual innuendos.

"Poker Face" was acclaimed by most critics, who praised the song's robotic hook and chorus. The
song attained worldwide success, topping the charts in 20 countries including the United States,
the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many European countries. With over 14
million copies, "Poker Face" is one of the world's best-selling singles of all time and became
the best-selling single of 2009 worldwide with over 9.8 million in sales that year alone. The
accompanying music video for the song portrays Gaga singing it in various costumes and playing
strip poker in a getaway villa. It was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) in 2015.

Gaga performed the song on the eighth season of the television show American Idol, besides multiple 
other television appearances, as well as the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, all of her concert tours, 
and the Super Bowl LI halftime show. "Poker Face" was nominated for both Song of the Year and
