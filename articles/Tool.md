Fear Inoculum is the fifth studio album by American rock band Tool. 
It was released on August 30, 2019, through Tool Dissectional, Volcano Entertainment, and RCA Records. 
It is the band's first album in 13 years, due to creative, personal, and legal issues band members encountered 
since the release of 10,000 Days.  
The album topped five other national album charts in its opening week as well. 
Two songs off the album received Grammy nominations, the first single "Fear Inoculum", for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song, and "7empest",[1] for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance,  with the latter winning the award.

> Control, your delusion

> Insane and striking at random

> Victim of your certainty

> And therefore your doubt's not an option

> Blameless, the tempest will be just that

> So try as you may, feeble, your attempt to atone

> Your words to erase all the damage cannot

The album consists of seven main tracks of music, and a run time just short of 80 minutes, the maximum runtime of CDs. 

The concept of seven is a recurring theme of the album both musically and conceptually; Chancellor and Jones wrote guitar riffs in unusual time signatures related to the number seven, while Keenan introduced ideas related to seven as well.

The album also explores the concept of growing "older and wiser".
 Keenan explained that the album covers the idea of "embracing where we are right now, acknowledging where we've 
 come from and some of the things we've gone through." Keenan also advised that patience and multiple listens 
 were required in understanding the album, comparing it to a slowly developing movie.
