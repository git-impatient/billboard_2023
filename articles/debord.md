# *La PlanÃ¨te Malade - Guy Debord (1971)*

> "Revolution or death"

This slogan is no longer the lyrical expression of the revolted conscience, it is the [last word of the scientific thought of our century](https://autonomy.work/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Fridays4FutureV2.pdf). This applies to the perils of the species as well as to the impossibility of adhesion for the individuals. In this society where suicide is progressing as we know it, the specialists had to recognize, with a certain spite, that it had fallen to almost nothing in May 1968. This spring also obtained, without precisely storming it, a beautiful sky, because some cars had burned and all the others lacked gasoline to pollute. When it rains, when there are false clouds over Paris, never forget that it is the fault of the government. Alienated industrial production makes the rain.
