*Martin Longley* 2013
New York alto saxophonist Steve Coleman has pared his long-running Five Elements combo down to a pointed quartet, ditching the trimmings that have decorated recent incarnations.

This enables a particularly hardened cerebral-funk manifestation of Coleman’s M-Base sound. Actually, he insists that this isn’t a musical style, but rather an attitude behind its creation. Just as well, as in similar fashion to fellow altoman Ornette Coleman’s harmolodics method, nobody has ever adequately explained the ground-rule parameters of the form.
