# 1.Intro
## (from Wikipedia)
Bach: The Goldberg Variations is the debut album of Canadian classical pianist Glenn Gould. An interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg Variations (BWV 988), the 1956 record launched Gould's career as a renowned international pianist, and became one of the most well-known piano recordings. Sales were "astonishing" for a classical album: it was reported to have sold 40,000 copies by 1960, and had sold more than 100,000 by the time of Gould's death in 1982. In 1981, a year before his death, Gould made a new recording of the Goldberg Variations, sales of which exceeded two million by the year 2000.

# 2.Critical reception
## (also from Wikipedia)
At the time of the first album's release, Bach's Goldberg Variations—a set of 30 contrapuntal variations beginning and ending with an aria—were outside the standard piano repertoire, having been recorded on the instrument only a few times before, either on small labels or unreleased. The work was considered esoteric and technically demanding, requiring awkward hand crossing at times when played on a piano (these passages would be played on two manuals on a harpsichord). Gould's album both established the Goldberg Variations within the contemporary classical repertoire and made him an internationally famous pianist nearly "overnight". First played in concert by Gould in 1954, the composition was a staple of Gould's performances in the years following the recording.

# 3.Was Gould high ? A commentary by a top musicologist of our modern times.
## That is, me. The musicologist, not Gould. 
### I also feel I should say for clarity that I am not a commentary, and I am not high either ~~or only a little bit~~
On a more personal note this album is quite dope, despite Gould's persistent humming. You might think he is high on something but if he were he probably would not have such a clear and articulated way of playing. At least I hope he was sober, imagine if the dude could play like that while being on weed, it's already depressing enough to listen to him if you're insecure about your piano skills. Or perhaps he only unlocks such unparalleled keyboard-bending powers after consuming psychotropic substances. Kind of like Rock Lee in Naruto. I like Naruto.
