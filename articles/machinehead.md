Machine Head is the last album recorded by what is considered the "classic" lineup of British Hard Rock outfit, Deep Purple. It was recorded in Montreux in the winter of 1971, and released to major success in 1972. 

Most, if not all the tracks are considered nowadays quintessential classic rock songs. Among them:

 - Highway Star
 - Smoke on the Water 

Are the best known.


Most of the songs are characterized by intricate keyboard, guitar and drums parts that take advantage of simple, in comparison, bass lines and lyrical content.

#### A secret song:

Many fans do not know that one song was not released with the album. A ballad, "When I Blindman Cries" was not released with the original album as guitar player Richie Blackmore "Did not like it". 

The song was included in subsequent releases and remastered versions of the album.
